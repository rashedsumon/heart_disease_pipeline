# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that converts patient health records into real-time heart-disease risk scores. The system includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Optional unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
