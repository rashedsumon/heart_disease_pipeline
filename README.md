This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for predicting heart disease risk from patient health records.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) & feature selection
- Supervised ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Optional patient segmentation via K-Means
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions
- Model serialization for reproducibility

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
